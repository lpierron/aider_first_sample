## How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Access the Application:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address shown in the console when you run the app).

4.  **Generate and Download:**

    Click the "Generate Blink" button to generate the Arduino code and download it as a zip file.

## Notes

*   The application uses a temporary directory to store the generated files before zipping them. This directory is automatically cleaned up after the zip file has been sent to the user.
*   Error handling is included to catch potential issues during file creation, zipping, and directory removal.  Errors are logged to the console.
